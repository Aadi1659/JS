in arrays in JS, we can use .includes to see whether one element is present inside the arrray or not.

eg:
write a JS code to welcome people based on their names in the list, if not, write sorry.

code:
var friends = ["aditya","akshat","abhay","aniket"];
var myName = prompt("enter your name");
if (friends.includes(myName)==1){
    console.log("Welcome!");
}
else {
    console.log("Sorry!");
}
