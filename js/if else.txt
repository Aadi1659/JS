if else are conditonal operators

=== for equality
!== 
>
<
>=
<=

now the difference between === and == is that === also checks the matching data type, but == doesnt.
eg 1 == "1" will yield yes but 1 === "1" will yield no due to dissimilar data types.

comparitive operators are
&& and
|| or
! not

eg:
a function to check LEAP YEARS
solution:
function isLeap(year) {
    
   
    
      
    if (year%4===0){
        if (year%100 === 0){
            if (year%400===0){
                return "Leap year."
            }
            else {
                return "Not leap year."
            }
        }
        else{
            return "Leap year."
        }
    }
    else {
        return "Not leap year."
    }

    

 

}
